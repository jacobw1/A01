CSC444 Data Visualization
Assignment 1
Jacob Williams

1. I like to see data from different perspectives and I also need a 400 level course

2. I think I will learn new libraries and applications that can help visualize Data

3. python (3 years), Java (3 years), C (1 year)

4. I have made simple html and css files for previous classes. I have used a database to store and read information in csc460

5. In csc110 I remember creating a gerrymandering visual that takes a state name and creates multiple charts of every county and whether or not gerrymandering is present

6. I once attempted to recreate a Pokedex by downloading all the information for each Pokemon. I had to deal with the name, stats, pictures, locations, biology, etc.

7. I haven't really seen a lot of visualizations but I do like seeing path finding algorithms and the trails they leave.

8. I think I see a lot of charts like we discussed in class that don't show the real proportions of the chart

9. Maybe having small groups discuss inclass questions like zoom breakout rooms

10. I recently found out that car batteries last 3-4 years and a new one costs more than $200 :(
